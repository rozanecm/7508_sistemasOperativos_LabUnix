This is just a little samba 
Built upon a single note 
Other notes are bound to follow 
But the root is still that note 
Now this new one is the consequence 
Of the one we've just been through 
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable 
Consequence of you 

There's so many people who can 
Talk and talk and talk 
And just say nothing 
Or nearly nothing 
I have used up all the scale I know 
And at the end I've come to nothing 
Or nearly nothing 

So I came back to my first note 
As I must come back to you 
I will pour into that one note 
All the love I feel for you 
Anyone who wants the whole show 
Re mi fa sol la si do 
He will find himself with no show 
Better play the note you know
